# wwiseutil
`wwiseutil` is a tool for manipulating Wwise SoundBank files (`.bnk` or `.nbnk`) and File Packages (`.pck` or `.npck`). It currently support the following features with both a GUI or command line tool:

* __unpacking__: An input SoundBank or File Package can be unpacked, writing all of the embedded `.wem` files to a directory.
[ww2ogg](https://github.com/hcs64/ww2ogg/releases) can then be used to convert the `.wem` files to a playable Ogg Vorbis format. 

* __replacing__: The `.wem` files within a source can be replaced. All metadata stored within the file will be updated to support the replacement `.wem`s. Replacement `.wem` files are allowed to be larger or smaller than the original embedded `wem`.

* __loop editing__: Currently, loop editing of basic sound effects is supported. Support for different looping mechanisms will be supported in the future. Loop editing is currently only supported in the GUI.
